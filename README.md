# Bank_management_system_unit_testing

The Bank Management System is designed to simulate essential banking functionalities in a controlled environment. The system supports operations such as creating bank accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money, and checking account balances.
To ensure software reliability and correctness, unit testing is performed on individual modules using a testing framework. Test cases cover both positive and negative scenarios, including edge cases like insufficient balance, invalid account numbers, and boundary values. This project emphasizes test-driven development principles, code modularity, and software quality assurance practices.
